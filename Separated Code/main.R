## SET WORKING DIRECTORY -------------------------------------------------------
# set working directory to where your result file is located. Note if you are going to save the environment to create reusable filter inputs, this will also be the location the .RData file will be located
setwd("~/Downloads")

## SAVE RData-------------------------------------------------------------------
# Un-comment the code if you want to load the environment to re-use saved filters
# Before that we need to clear the environment (so whatever the client save on their own will be erased when the app refreshed but not the one we pre-loaded in for them)
# rm(list=ls())
# load("saved_filters.RData")

## LOAD RData-------------------------------------------------------------------
# Un-comment if you want to save the environment. As long as the environment is saved before you close RStudio, you can load it back in and use the saved filters again.
# Only do this step after you finish using the app. Only run this line of code individually.
# if(length(sav_name) > 1 & length(inputs) > 0){
#   save(sav_name, inputs, file = "saved_filters.RData")
# }

## GLOBAL VARIABLES-------------------------------------------------------------
# Used to stored sets of selected inputs we want to save with their names
# You will not lose the sets of selected inputs even if you close and re-load the app. But this doesn't apply when you close RStudio.
if(!exists("sav_name")){ sav_name <<- NA}
if(!exists("inputs")) { inputs <<- list()}

## LOAD RESULTS FILE -----------------------------------------------------------
# Read in the results file and do some data preparation
# Any character data will be converted into factor variable. Same for the Year variable.
results <- read_csv("results.csv")
results <- results %>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor) %>% mutate(Year = factor(Year))

#References the Intro_Help_Pages.R file where the code for creating the intro & help pages are located
source("Intro_Help_Pages.R")

#References the ui.R file where the ui(front-end) code is located
source("ui.R")

#References the server.R file where the server(back-end) code is located
source("server.R")


## CREATE SHINY APP-------------------------------------------------------------  
# Connect the ui (front-end) with the server (back-end)
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
